## ðŸ§© How It Works

Each test feature file (`.feature`) follows **Gherkin** syntax:

```gherkin
Feature: Create Board
  As a user
  I want to create a new board
  So that I can manage my tasks

  @smoke @api
  Scenario: User successfully creates a board
    Given the user has valid Trello API credentials
    When the user sends a request to create a board named "My Board"
    Then the board should be created successfully

```
